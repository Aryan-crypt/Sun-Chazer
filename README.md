# Sun-Chazer

**Sun-Chazer** is a solar tracker system utilizing the ESP8266 microcontroller. It uses two servos to position a solar panel based on real-time solar intensity readings, aiming to maximize efficiency by adjusting the panel's orientation.

## Features
- Tracks the sun using servo motors.
- Reads solar panel voltage to determine optimal position.
- Control the system via a web interface hosted on ESP8266.
- Start and monitor tracking remotely.

## Components Used
- **ESP8266**: For web server and controlling servos.
- **Servo Motors**: For adjusting the solar panel's orientation.
- **Relay**: For controlling the motor's direction.
- **Solar Panel**: For measuring light intensity and adjusting positioning.
